Example. As an example, FileInfo is useful if your program modifies files, and you want to see how many bytes have been added or removed. This is useful for compression or just data analysis.

Here:

C# program that gets file size

using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
	// The name of the file.
	const string fileName = "test.txt";

	// Create new FileInfo object and get the Length.
	FileInfo f = new FileInfo(fileName);
	long s1 = f.Length;

	// Change something with the file.
	File.AppendAllText(fileName
